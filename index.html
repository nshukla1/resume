                <p>
                    Hello! I am Niraj Shukla, am an avid aspiring researcher and dedicated educator with a strong
                    background in fintech, currently seeking a PhD position to further my academic journey. With a
                    passion for exploring the intersection of technology and finance, I have immersed myself in various
                    projects that focus on digital payments, data analytics, and product management within the fintech
                    sector. My experience as a professor has allowed me to share my knowledge and inspire students in
                    subjects like systems architecture, marketing analytics, and web design, fostering a learning
                    environment that encourages critical thinking and innovation. As I continue to advance my career, I
                    am eager to delve deeper into research that addresses contemporary challenges in financial
                    technology and information systems, contributing to the academic community while shaping the next
                    generation of professionals in this dynamic field. My commitment to education and research drives my
                    ambition to pursue a PhD, where I can engage with like-minded scholars and make meaningful
                    contributions to our understanding of fintech's evolving landscape.
